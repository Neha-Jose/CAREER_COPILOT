AdaptiveCareerAgent is an agentic AI system that autonomously manages a student’s professional growth.  
Instead of offering static career advice, it continuously analyzes user profiles, job market demand, learning progress, and competitor skills to generate a personalized roadmap that evolves over time.

This project was built for Vibeathon as a **career co-pilot**, not a chatbot.

### 🔄 Closed-Loop Adaptive Intelligence

The system follows:

State → Plan → Execute → Evaluate → Replan

Every week:

- If progress < 60% → reinforcement tasks are injected
- If progress ≥ 60% → advanced material is unlocked
- Competitor skill delta automatically reprioritizes roadmap

The roadmap evolves based on performance and market signals.

### 🧠 Persistent Agent Memory

Agent state is stored across sessions:

- Current week
- Completed days
- Progress score
- Employability percentage

This enables long-term personalization and continuous learning without resetting.
